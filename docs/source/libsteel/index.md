# About LibSteel

LibSteel is a software library providing boot code, trap handlers and an API for controlling RISC-V Steel, making it easier to develop new software applications for it.

LibSteel comes pre-installed in the [template projects](../userguide.md#building-the-application) and [examples](../examples/helloworld.md), being ready to use. It does not require any additional setup.
