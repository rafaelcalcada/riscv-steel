# About LibSteel

LibSteel is a software library providing boot code, trap handlers and an API for controlling the devices of the [Microcontroller IP](hardware/mcu.md), making it easier to develop applications with RISC-V Steel.

LibSteel comes pre-installed in the [template projects](userguide.md#building-the-application) and [examples](examples/helloworld.md), being ready to use. It does not require any additional setup.
