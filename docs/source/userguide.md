## Introduction

The process of developing a new application with RISC-V Steel can be divided into two steps:

1. Writing the software for the application

    You start by writing the source code for the new application and building it using the RISC-V GNU Toolchain. The building process generates a `.hex` file that is later used to initialize the Microcontroller IP.

2. Running the application

    Once you have built the application, you can run it on the Microcontroller IP. To do this, you need to implement an instance of the Microcontroller IP on an FPGA, which is configured for the target FPGA and initialized with the application you wrote.

## Prerequisites

To build software for RISC-V Steel you need the [RISC-V GNU Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain), a suite of compilers and development tools for the RISC-V architecture. 

Run the commands below to install and configure the toolchain for RISC-V Steel:

!!! note ""

    __Important!__ The `--prefix` option defines the installation folder. You need to set it to a folder where you have `rwx` permissions. The commands below assume you have `rwx` permissions on `/opt`.

=== "Ubuntu"

    ```
    # Clone the RISC-V GNU Toolchain repo

    # Configure the toolchain for RISC-V Steel
    cd riscv-gnu-toolchain && ./configure --with-arch=rv32izicsr --with-abi=ilp32 --prefix=/opt/riscv

    # Configure the toolchain for RISC-V Steel
    cd riscv-gnu-toolchain && ./configure --with-arch=rv32izicsr --with-abi=ilp32 --prefix=/opt/riscv

    # Compile and install
    make -j $(nproc)
    ```

## Writing the application

The quickest way to start a new application is to make a copy of the `template/` folder and edit the `main.c` file in it. 

The `template/` folder consists of a CMake project that preconfigures the RISC-V GNU Toolchain to compile and link software for RISC-V Steel, so you can start writing the application right away without having to worry about configuring the compiler.

    # Clone RISC-V Steel repository (if not cloned yet)
    git clone https://github.com/riscv-steel/riscv-steel
    
    # Make a copy of the template software project
    cp riscv-steel/template/ new_project/

See the examples section to learn how to develop software for the features in the Microcontroller IP.

To build the application you wrote, simply run `make` from the project root folder:

    cd new_project/
    make

A successfull build ends with a message like this:

```
Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
             RAM:        1264 B         8 KB     15.43%
-------------------------------------------------------
Build outputs:
-- ELF executable:    build/myapp.elf
-- Memory init file:  build/myapp.hex
-- Disassembly:       build/myapp.objdump
```

The `.hex` file generated by the build process will be used in the next step to initialize the memory of the Microcontroller IP.

## Running on FPGA

Once you have generated the `.hex` file for the application, you can implement the Microcontroller IP on an FPGA to run it. Implementing the Microcontroller IP on an FPGA consists of two steps:

- First, you create a wrapper module with an instance of the Microcontroller IP. The instance is configured for the target FPGA and initialized with the application it will run.

- Then, using the FPGA vendor's software, you synthesize this wrapper module and program the FPGA with it.

Let's do the first part. Using your preferred text editor, create a Verilog file named `rvsteel_mcu_wrapper.v` and add the code below.

    __Important:__ Don't forget to change the file as instructed in the comments!

```verilog

module rvsteel_mcu_wrapper (
  
  input   wire          clock       ,
  input   wire          reset       ,
  input   wire          halt        ,

  // UART
  // Remove it if your application does not use the UART.
  input   wire          uart_rx     ,
  output  wire          uart_tx     ,

  // General Purpose I/O
  // Remove it if your application does not use the GPIO.
  input   wire  [3:0]   gpio_input  ,
  output  wire  [3:0]   gpio_oe     ,
  output  wire  [3:0]   gpio_output ,

  // Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
  // Remove it if your application does not use the SPI controller.
  output  wire          sclk        ,
  output  wire          pico        ,
  input   wire          poci        ,
  output  wire  [0:0]   cs
  
  );

  reg reset_debounced;
  always @(posedge clock) reset_debounced <= reset;

  reg halt_debounced;
  always @(posedge clock) halt_debounced <= halt;

  rvsteel_mcu #(

    // Frequency (in Hertz) of your FPGA board's clock
    .CLOCK_FREQUENCY          (50000000                   ),
    // Absolute path to the .hex init file
    // This file is generated when you build the application and is saved in
    // the `build` folder
    .MEMORY_INIT_FILE         ("/path/to/myapp.hex"       ),    
    // Set here the size you want for the memory (in bytes)
    .MEMORY_SIZE              (8192                       ),
    // Set here the UART baud rate (in bauds per second)

    // Width of the cs port
    .SPI_NUM_CHIP_SELECT      (1                          ))
    
    rvsteel_mcu_instance      (
    
    .clock                    (clock                      ),
    .reset                    (reset_debounced            ),
    .halt                     (halt_debounced             ),
    .uart_rx                  (uart_rx                    ),
    .uart_tx                  (uart_tx                    ),
    .gpio_input               (gpio_input                 ),
    .gpio_oe                  (gpio_oe                    ),
    .gpio_output              (gpio_output                ),
    .sclk                     (sclk                       ),
    .pico                     (pico                       ),
    .poci                     (poci                       ),
    .cs                       (cs                         ));

endmodule
```

Now you need to synthesize the module above on an FPGA to finally run the application. The steps to synthesize it vary depending on the FPGA model and vendor, but generally follow this order:

- Start a new project on the EDA tool provided by your FPGA vendor (e.g. AMD Vivado, Intel Quartus, Lattice iCEcube)
- Add the following files to the project:
    - The Verilog file created above, `rvsteel_mcu_wrapper.v`.
    - All Microcontroller IP [source files](hardware/mcu.md#source-files).
- Create a design constraints file and map the ports of `rvsteel_mcu_wrapper.v` to the respective devices on the FPGA board.
- Run synthesis, place and route, and any other intermediate step needed to generate a bitstream for the FPGA.
- Generate the bitstream and program the FPGA with it.

After programming the FPGA, the application should start running immediately!
