<h2 id="h2-homepage-no-top-margin">About RISC-V Steel</h2>

RISC-V Steel is a 32-bit RISC-V Microcontroller IP written in Verilog for use in embedded systems, systems-on-chip and FPGAs. It is distributed under a free license and can be easily integrated into any project.

RISC-V Steel features a 32-bit RISC-V processor core, memory, timers, and UART, GPIO and SPI controllers. It can run bare-metal embedded software as well as real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS).

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

The quickest way to get started is to implement one of the example projects on your FPGA. Try it out:

- [Hello World Example](examples/helloworld.md) 
- FreeRTOS Example

See the [User Guide](userguide.md) to learn how to create new applications.
