### About RISC-V Steel

RISC-V Steel is a portfolio of RISC-V-based hardware modules written in Verilog for building embedded systems, systems-on-chip or FPGA implementation. RISC-V Steel modules are free and open, can be easily integrated into any project and come with documentation and examples.

### What's in?

- 32-bit RISC-V processor core (RV32I + Zicsr and M-mode)
- UART, GPIO and SPI controllers
- Timer and memory modules
- A RISC-V microcontroller integrating all the modules above

### Features

- The microcontroller and the processor core support running real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS)
- Software examples and template projects

### License

RISC-V Steel is licensed under the **MIT License**.
