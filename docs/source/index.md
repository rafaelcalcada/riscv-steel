## About RISC-V Steel

RISC-V Steel is a free collection of hardware modules written in Verilog intended for use in FPGAs and embedded systems. It features a 32-bit RISC-V processor core, UART, GPIO and SPI interfaces, and timer and memory modules. All modules are integrated into a tunable microcontroller design that can be easily ported to any FPGA in just a few steps.

## Features

- 32-bit RISC-V processor core (RV32I + Zicsr + Machine mode)
- UART, GPIO and SPI interfaces
- Timer and memory modules
- Support for real-time operating systems like FreeRTOS
- LibSteel library, which provides an API to control RISC-V Steel
