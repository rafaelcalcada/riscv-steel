<h2 id="h2-homepage-no-top-margin">About RISC-V Steel</h2>

RISC-V Steel is a RISC-V Microcontroller IP written in Verilog targeted for embedded systems, systems-on-chip and FPGAs.

Its design comprises a 32-bit RISC-V processor core, memory and timers, as well as UART, GPIO and SPI controllers. The UART, GPIO and SPI interfaces allow RISC-V Steel to communicate with a wide variety of sensors and actuators commonly used in embedded systems.

RISC-V Steel can be easily integrated into any project and supports executing real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS) as well as bare-metal embedded software.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

The quickest way to get started is to implement one of the example projects on your FPGA. Try it out:

- [Hello World Example](examples/helloworld.md) 
- [FreeRTOS Example](examples/freertos.md)

See the [User Guide](userguide.md) to learn how to create your own applications.
