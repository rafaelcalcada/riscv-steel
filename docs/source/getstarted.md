# Getting Started

## Introduction

This guide shows how to synthesize RISC-V Steel MCU demo project for two Digilent development boards: [Arty A7](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual) and [Cmod A7](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/cmod-a7/reference-manual).

The demo project is a Hello World application that makes RISC-V Steel MCU send a "Hello World!" message to your computer via the board's UART interface. Its goal is to quickly introduce you to RISC-V Steel MCU so that you can expand it and develop your own embedded applications.

    __Looking for the demo project for other development boards?__

    We are willing to help! Let us know which development board you would like the demo project ported to by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/riscv-steel/riscv-steel/issues/new) on GitHub.

## First steps

To follow this guide you'll need one of the following FPGA boards:

* **Digilent** [**Arty A7**](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual)

* **Digilent** [**Cmod A7**](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/cmod-a7/reference-manual)

Also, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

* **AMD Xilinx Vivado**

    The latest version of AMD Xilinx Vivado is available for [download here](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html).

    During installation, remember to include support for the Artix-7 device family and the cable drivers.

* **PySerial**

    [PySerial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Python package for communication over serial protocol. It can be installed by running:

    ```
    python -m pip install pyserial
    ```

## Get RISC-V Steel

Clone RISC-V Steel repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/riscv-steel/riscv-steel.git
```

## Start PySerial

Connect your Digilent board to your computer using a USB cable and start PySerial terminal by running:

```
python -m serial.tools.miniterm
```

A list of available serial ports will follow. Select the port your board is connected to and **keep the terminal open** for the next steps.

## Program the FPGA

Open **AMD Xilinx Vivado** and follow the steps:

1. Click **Run Tcl Script** in the **Tools** menu.

2. Select `hello_world_???.tcl` and click **Ok**. The `???` stands for your board name.

    This file is located at `demos/boards/???/` and it creates the demo project for your board in Vivado.

3. Click on **Generate Bitstream** in the **Flow** menu.

4. Click **Open Hardware Manager** in the **Flow** menu.

5. Click **Auto Connect** in the **Tools** menu.

6. Click **Program Device** in the **Tools** menu. A dialog box asking you to provide the bitstream will open.

7. Search for `hello_world_???.bit`. Again, the `???` stands for your board name.

    This file is located at `demos/boards/???/hello_world_???/hello_world_???.runs/impl_1/`.

8. Click on **Program** and wait for Vivado to finish programming the FPGA.

Now go back to PySerial terminal window. You should see the message below:

## Next steps

If you've reached this point, congratulations! You have a working instance of RISC-V Steel MCU. You can now change it to create your own embedded applications.

- **Run your own software**

    The [RISC-V Steel MCU Software Guide](softwareguide.md) contains instructions on how to write, compile, and run software applications for RISC-V Steel MCU.

- **Expand the design**

    The [RISC-V Steel MCU Documentation](mcu.md) contains detailed information about its design so that you can expand it to create larger projects.
