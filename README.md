RISC-V Steel is a microcontroller design developed in Verilog that implements the RV32I instruction set of RISC-V. It is designed for easy, seamless integration into embedded systems, systems-on-chip (SoC), and FPGA designs, facilitating the rapid development of innovative RISC-V applications.

RISC-V Steel can run real-time operating systems such as FreeRTOS, as well as bare-metal embedded software. Its design includes components such as memory, timers, and interfaces for UART, GPIO, and SPI communication, enabling RISC-V Steel to integrate with a variety of sensors and actuators commonly used in embedded applications.
