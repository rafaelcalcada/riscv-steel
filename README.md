RISC-V Steel is an open collection of RISC-V based Intellectual Property (IP) for FPGAs written in Verilog. It features two main IPs:

- **Steel Core**, a 32-bit RISC-V processor
- **Steel MCU**, a microcontroller unit integrating Steel Core + UART, GPIO, SPI, timer and memory modules.

RISC-V Steel is designed to make it easier to develop embedded applications with FPGA boards. **Steel MCU** can be easily ported to any FPGA and consumes few resources.
