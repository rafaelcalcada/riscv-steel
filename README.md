**RISC-V Steel** is a free and open collection of RISC-V IP that is simple, robust and easy to use. It features a 32-bit RISC-V processor core, a configurable system-on-chip design and a suite of software and hardware tools aimed to speed up building RISC-V embedded applications.

## Available IP

#### Processor Core

RISC-V Steel Processor Core implements the RV32I ISA, the Zicsr extension and the Machine-mode privileged architecture of RISC-V.
