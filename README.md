---

**RISC-V Steel** is a free and open collection of RISC-V IP that is simple, robust and easy to use. It features a 32-bit RISC-V processor core, a configurable system-on-chip design and a suite of software and hardware tools aimed to speed up building RISC-V embedded applications.

- [Software Guide](https://riscv-steel.github.io/riscv-steel/software-guide/)

#### Processor Core IP

A 32-bit processor core design implementing the RV32I ISA, the Zicsr extension and the Machine-mode privileged architecture of RISC-V.

## Getting Started

The [Getting Started Guide](https://riscv-steel.github.io/riscv-steel/getting-started/) shows you how to synthesize the [Hello World](https://github.com/riscv-steel/riscv-steel/tree/main/hello-world) demo for some popular FPGA boards. The demo is an instance of RISC-V Steel SoC IP that sends a Hello World message to a host computer via UART protocol. Its goal is to introduce you to the SoC design so that you can expand it and run your own software.
