RISC-V Steel is a RISC-V Microcontroller IP written in Verilog targeted for embedded systems, systems-on-chip and FPGAs.

Its design comprises a 32-bit RISC-V processor core, memory and timers, as well as UART, GPIO and SPI controllers. The UART, GPIO and SPI interfaces allow RISC-V Steel to communicate with a wide variety of sensors and actuators commonly used in embedded systems.

RISC-V Steel can be easily integrated into any project and supports executing real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS) as well as bare-metal embedded software.

Check out [RISC-V Steel Documentation][1].

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to implement one of the example projects on your FPGA. Try it out!
