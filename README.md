RISC-V Steel is a 32-bit RISC-V Microcontroller IP written in Verilog for use in embedded systems, systems-on-chip and FPGAs. It is distributed under a free license and can be easily integrated into any project.

RISC-V Steel features a 32-bit RISC-V processor core, memory, timers, and UART, GPIO and SPI controllers. It can run bare-metal embedded software as well as real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS).

Check out [RISC-V Steel Documentation][1].

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to implement one of the example projects on your FPGA. Try it out!

- [Hello World Example][2]
- [FreeRTOS Example][3]

See the [User Guide][4] to learn how to create your own applications.
